\chapter{Future Work}
In regards to future work, completing the Python prototype is highly relevant. 
An interesting part is implementing the D4' dispersion model. 

Completing the prototype is a crucial step towards the main prize of a fully lock-step parallel implementation of the algorithm. 

Regarding the quantum algorithms we wanted to investigate using QSVD transforms for some of the terms that are more heavy on tensors. This would be a good thesis topic for anyone interested in quantum algorithm design. It would also be interesting to investigate if any of the approximations in GFN2-xTB are unnecessary in the domain of quantum computing.

We feel that the advent of g-xTB warrants taking another look at the choice of method and potentially adapting our work to the new method.
