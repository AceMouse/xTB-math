\chapter{GAI declaration}
Generative AI has been used in the making of this thesis.

Specifically ChatGPT has been used as a patient explainer of basic chemistry and Fortran in the research phase.

Asmus tried to get it to help with debugging, with no success, as it is underwhelming in its ability to reason about the quantum chemistry it explains in terms of correct code. 
It is however surprisingly good at linking the short variable names in the reference implementation of GFN2-xTB to googlable terms, which was quite needed.

None of the output is part of the code or this thesis.
