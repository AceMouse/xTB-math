In @fig:sun you can see a common representation of the Sun, which is a star that is located at the center of the solar system.

In @tab:planets, you see the planets of the solar system and their average distance from the Sun.
The distances were calculated with @eq:gamma that we presented in @sec:methods.

= Parallel Computing

Find out how large nbf can get, aka how many iterations the loops in electro can be. Based on that we would choose between the cpu or gpu version, or only use the cpu version if iterations are at most < 100k or such.

= Lockstep Parallel Electrostatics and Self-Consistent-Charges
```python
def electro(nbf, H0, P, dq, dqsh, atomicGam, shellGam, jmat, shift):

    es = get_isotropic_electrostatic_energy(dq, dqsh, atomicGam, shellGam, jmat, shift)

    k = 0
    h = 0.0
    for i in range(nbf):
        for j in range(i):
            h += P[i,j] * H0[k]
            k += 1
        h += P[i,i] * H0[k] * 0.5
        k += 1

    scc = es + 2.0 * h * evtoau
    return es, scc
```

#v(10pt)

Pseudo code for a lockstep implementation.
```python
def electro(nbf, H0, P, dq, dqsh, atomicGam, shellGam, jmat, shift):
    es = get_isotropic_electrostatic_energy(dq, dqsh, atomicGam, shellGam, jmat, shift)

    h_dev = sycl_malloc(number_of_blocks * block_size)

    ######### KERNEL ##########
    idx = block * blocksize + thread
    
    if (thread < block):
        h_dev[idx] = P[idx] * H0[idx]

    if (thread == block):
        h_dev[idx] = P[idx] * H0[idx] * 0.5

    # barrier
    reduce(h_dev)
    ###########################

    # copy hr from device to host
    h = sycl_move(h_dev)

    scc = es + 2.0 * h * evtoau
    return es, scc
```
