We take a step towards faster screening for large isomer spaces of fullerenes by introducing both GPU and quantum algorithms for approximating their chemical energies. To this end we implement a prototype for large parts of a semi-empirical method obtaining energies matching the reference implementation. We show that this method is lockstep-parallel for isomer spaces with fixed element ordering and how to reduce computations by only considering fullerenes. The quantum algorithms provided allow sampling of isomers with low isotropic energy from the entire isomer space, with better than classical probability, using qubits logarithmic in the size of the isomer space and having circuit depth quadratic in the number of atoms in an isomer.
