\chapter{Reflections}
We will briefly reflect upon the project, including outside changes and internal choices.

The xTB family of algorithms presented by Grimme et al. is still being actively developed. In fact g-xTB came out a little over half way though this project and is rather impressive regarding accuracy and breadth. We urge anyone continuing this project to consider if the resulting changes impact fullerens enough to warrant switching to the new method. We were unable to as the reference implementation has still not landed in the tblite repository, and the associated paper is still only a preprint available on chemRxiv. 

The tools we choose for this project e.g. Python and Nix, have been good choices in so far as making the development of a correct prototype a pleasant process. We recommend continuing with this setup. Especially the testing setup with nix will keep paying dividends ensuring correctness as we transition from a prototype to a high performance implementation.
