Now that we have taken a look at the computations performed by the xTB method, we can begin to see that the steps are the same for all molecules, and that the exact amount of steps are identical between isomers. Isomers are molecules that are identical in their composition of atoms, that is, they have the same molecular formula, and differ only in the relative positions between atoms or the bonds between them.
This project focuses on large isomer spaces of fullerenes in the range \(C_{20}, \cdots, C_{200} \) which is a total of $2157751423$ molecules, or in other words in the order of $10^9$. A fullerene is a molecule consisting only of carbon atoms where each atom has three neighbors and is arranged such that the molecule produces a mesh of exactly $12$ pentagonal faces and the rest being hexagonal faces.

\caption{Each carbon atom in a fullerene has exactly 3 neighboring carbon atoms.}
\label{fig:carbon-degree}
\end{figure}

For each isomerspace we essentially have two matrices, one for the coordinates of each carbon atom, and one containing the three neighbors for each of the atoms. The first matrix as seen in \autoref{fig:isomerspace_atom_coords}, is of size $N \times 3 \times M$ where $N$ is the amount of atoms for each of the fullerenes within the same isomerspace, $3$ is the three coordinates for each atom, and $M$ is the amount of fullerenes within the isomerspace. The second matrix as seen in \autoref{fig:isomerspace_atom_neighbors}, is the exact same, but instead of coordinates it holds the indices for the three neighboring carbon atoms. The xTB method only needs the positions for each atom, so we are not concerned with the second matrix.

% TODO: Is it true that we do not need the second matrix?

The xTB program takes a single molecule as input, but the fact that fullerenes in the same isomerspace executes the same series of instructions, makes a great case for lockstep parallelism. Running computations in lockstep means doing the exact same instructions in parallel, and if we can do this, then we can efficiently utilize the single instruction, multiple threads (SIMT) execution model. The SIMT model is used when a warp scheduler dispatches a single instruction to all threads within a warp. All of the threads in the warp will then execute the instruction simultaniously, which means that they are synchronized at a hardware level. This perfect as it means that we can use warps to execute instructions for multiple fullerenes in lockstep. With this in mind, instead of feeding the program a single fullerene at a time, we want to give it a complete isomerspace so that we can utilize all threads on one or even multiple GPUs. The largest isomerspace we consider is $C_{200}$, which is $214127742$ fullerenes, or in other words in the order of $10^8$.

It takes around $30$ seconds for a 12th generation Intel mobile processor to run xTB-GFN2 on a single $C_{200}$ fullerene. Going through the whole isomerspace on this CPU would take about $204$ years to complete. This is a bit long to wait for a failed run, and by that time we will probably have achieved more efficient ways of computation, or the world might simply have more pressing matters than keeping this computer alive. The degree of lockstep parallelism scales with the isomerspace, and since there are no interdependencies between the molecules, this makes it a perfect case for horizontal scaling by using hundreds or even thousands or GPUs. The CPU used has $12$ cores and $24$ threads, $12$ of which can run in parallel. An NVIDIA GPU has hundredthousands of threads and tenthousands of CUDA cores, though these cores are not equivalent to a CPU cores, and we can in general not compare thea relative performance between the two by looking at their specifications. We can say however, that a GPU is much more capable of massive parallelism, which is what we seek for these massive isomerspaces.
%as they refer to the amount of arithmetic logic units (ALUs), while a modern CPU core has multiple ALUs.

%Distributing the isomerspace over $1000$ threads would cut this down to a measly $2.5$ months. This is still a lot and it also assumes that the clock cycles on a GPU is just as fast as on the Intel CPU, which they are not, but this is fine, because we have a lot more than $1000$ threads to work with.

%A single C200 molecule takes ... so this many would take... distributing it over 1000 would take this much wall time..
%By using multiple GPUs we can distribute these huge isomerspaces 

%We want to run molecules in lockstep. Fullerenes in the same isomerspace does the same steps. We have to find the upperbound for iterations and array allocations to run the exact same instructions for each. If we do the exact same on molecules within the same warp, then we can get a constant flow of throughput since we will need no barriers. In this case, synchronization is not needed within the same warp, so no barriers! Doing the exact same on the level of isomers is great, because we have so many, so we can keep scaling up the hardware to use 100, 1000 GPUs and we will still be able to utilize all cores because the isomerspace sizes scale in the order of magnitude of 10\^9 or something.

\section{Case Study}

To get an idea of the scale of parallelism we can achieve on a single GPU, we will take a look at the memory specifications of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture. We hope to use this to get an idea of how many fullerenes can fit into memory.

Using all the levels of memory on a GPU efficiently is crucial to achieve high performance in parallel computing tasks. Let us therefore take a moment to familiarize ourselves with the different types typically found in the memory hiearchy on a GPU. Below you will find an overview of the various memory levels with short explanations for each of them:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Global - Accessible from all threads on the GPU. This is the largest but also the slowest pool of memory.
  \item Shared - Tied to a thread block (or workgroup), so it can be accessed by the threads in the same thread block. This pool of memory is smaller but faster than global memory.
  \item Register Memory - Each thread on a GPU has private access to a number of registers. This is the fastest type of memory used to store local variables and intermediate results.
  \item Local Memory - Also private to each thread. This type is slower than register memory and is usually used when there is insufficient space for variables on the registers of a thread.
\end{itemize}

% There are 4 warp schedulers(1 per SMSP) so 4 per SM. These schedule up to 16 warps concurrently where each is either from one or several block, from one or several kernels. 4 * 16 = 64 max warps.
% 4 schedulers * 32 threads/warp = 128 threads/cycle
% Each scheduler can schedule up to 2 instructions per cycle? so 256 instructions/cycle
% This is for Kepler, check for Ada

% This matches the nvidia whitepaper above where it states the whole number as 65536 32-bit registers / SM.

% Smid regnestykker ind i en klar "example" for Ada, og skriv hvad de skal bruges til!

The NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU architecture\cite{nvidia-ada-architecture} has $80$ GB of global memory, and $18432$ CUDA cores spread across $144$ SMs, resulting in $128$ CUDA cores per SM.

To find out how many fullerenes worth of coordinate data can fit into global memory, we can use the following equation:

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
        GlobalMemFullereneCapacity &= \floor*{\frac{GlobalMemInBits}{FullereneAtomCount \times 3 \times 64}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\caption{The amount of 3-dimensional fullerene coordinate data that fits in global memory. The $3 \times 64$ comes from the three $64$-bit floating point numbers that represents the 3-dimensional coordinates. This equation does not consider other data such as results or intermediate values.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
        MinimumGPUsToFitIsomerspace &= \ceil*{\frac{GlobalMemFullereneCapacity}{IsomerspaceSize}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\caption{The minimum number of GPUs required to fit a complete isomerspace in global memory at once.}
\end{figure}

Be aware that this equation does not consider any space needed for the results or any intermediate values, but we can use this equation to calculate the minimum amount of GPUs required to fit the whole isomerspace. If we do want to fit the whole isomerspace at once, then we might need to add additional GPUs to account for the intermediate values and results. Using the equations for the $C_{200}$ isomerspace tells us that we need a minimum of $13$ GPUs with $80$ GB of global memory each.

We are also interested in knowing how much non-global memory is available to each xTB computation. Knowing this will tell us how many of the threads, warps, and blocks we can utilize on the GPU. To figure this out, we first need to know how much of the various memory levels are available to a single thread if distributed over all threads.

Each SM has $128$ KB L1/Shared Memory and is divided into four partitions, each containing a $64$ KB register file, an L0 instruction cache, one warp scheduler, one dispatch unit, 16 CUDA Cores dedicated for processing FP32 operations (up to 16 FP32 operations per clock), 16 CUDA Cores that can process FP32 or INT32 operations (16 FP32 operations per clock OR 16 INT32 operations per clock), and a tensor core. See \autoref{fig:ada-SM-architecture} for a figure of the SM architecture.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/nvidia-ada-gpu-architecture}
\caption{The NVIDIA Ada Lovelace Architecture for a streaming-multiprocessor. \cite[Figure 5]{nvidia-ada-architecture}}
\label{fig:ada-SM-architecture}
\end{figure}

There are $48$ warps per SM, so each warp scheduler has $12$ warps allocated to them. Each warp has $32$ threads, so if we distribute the register file over the $384$ threads, then each of them have $166$ bytes (see \autoref{eq:reg_per_thread}). This is only $41.5$ of the maximum of $255$ $32$-bit registers that a single thread can have, so if needed then we can allocate more memory to each thread by utilizing fewer of them.

To get the amount of shared memory available to each thread when distributed evenly, we can use \autoref{eq:shared_per_thread}. There is $128$ KB of shared memory per SM, so each thread has $83$ bytes to work with.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
        RegisterMemoryPerThread &= \frac{RegisterFile}{WarpsPerPartition \times ThreadsPerWarp} \label{eq:reg_per_thread}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
        SharedMemoryPerThread &= \frac{SharedMemoryPerSM}{WarpsPerSM \times ThreadsPerWarp} \label{eq:shared_per_thread}
\end{split}
\end{equation}


Depending on the upperbound on intermediate data required by the xTB algorithm, we can tweak the amount of non-global memory available to each fullerene by using fewer threads, warp, and blocks. For example, using only $16$ of the $32$ threads in each warp will double the available register and shared memory for each thread. There is a point of diminishing returns as a single thread is limited to a maximum of $255$ $32$-bit registers. In the case that the non-global memory alone is not enough to hold the intermediate data of a molecule, then we will need to also utilize global memory. Shared memory has a latency of $20$ to $30$ cycles while global memory has a latency of $200$ to $1000$ cycles\cite{nasa-nvidia-basics}. Global memory is slow to access, so when used it becomes especially important to place data strategically to allow for coalesced access.

%Each SM has a maximum of $24$ blocks and a maximum of $48$ warps. This adds up such that full utilization can be achieved when each block has $2$ warps allocated. A warp has $32$ threads, so an SM has a total of $1536$ threads when each of its $24$ blocks has two warps.
%%By using \autoref{eq:reg_mem_utilized_per_sm} we can see that this configuration utilizes $251.9$ KB of the register memory available to each of the SMs.
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%  WarpsPerBlock &= \floor*{\frac{WarpsPerSM}{BlocksPerSM}}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%  ThreadsPerBlock &= WarpsPerBlock \times ThreadsPerWarp
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%  RegistersPerThread &= \floor*{\frac{RegistersPerSM}{BlocksPerSM \times ThreadsPerBlock}}

%  &\times RegistersPerThread\\
%  &\times BitsPerRegister
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%
%BlocksPerSM and BitsPerRegister are constants found in the specification for the GPU architecture.
%
%With this, each block in an SM has $10.496$ KB of register memory to work with, and thus each thread has $164$ bytes.
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%  \frac{251.904}{24} &= 10.496 \text{ KB}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%  \frac{251904}{1536} &= 164 \text{ bytes}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%
%The shared memory capacity per SM is $100$ KB and a single block can have a maximum of $99$ KB. This gives each block about $4.16$ KB of shared memory, meaning that the $64$ threads in a block will have $65$ bytes each.
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%  \frac{100}{24} &= 4.166 \text{ KB}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%  \frac{4166}{64} &= 65.09 \text{ bytes}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%
%The Ada Lovelace architecture has a total of $128$ SMs and it also has a $98304$ KB L2 cache. This results in a total of $3072$ blocks that each has $32$ KB of the L2 Cache. All of this combined gives each block a total of $46.656$ KB of non-global memory.
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%  10.496 \text{ KB} + 4.166 \text{ KB} + 32 \text{ KB} &= 46.662 \text{ KB}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%
%Distributing the global memory across the blocks gives each of them $26.042$ MB. Combined with the non-global memory, this results in each block having a total of $26.088$ MB of memory.

%\subsection{Optimizing GPU Configuration for Isolated Molecules}
%
%Computing xTB-GFN2 for a molecule is completely isolated, so if we do the whole xTB computation in lockstep, then we only have to concern ourselves with how many warps and blocks a single molecule needs in order to keep all its data in device memory. When we know these details, then we can simply scale up the number of molecules to be computed in lockstep until all the resources on the GPU are saturated. With this approach, expanding to multiple GPUs should be rather trivial as there are no interdependencies.
%
%The exact space needed to compute the GFN2 method of xTB for a single fullerene is not yet clear to us, and it will also vary based on the size of the fullerene. To make finding the most optimal GPU configuration easier when optimizing for most possible parallel xTB computations, we have developed a script that computes such a configuration based on the space requirement of a single molecule.
%
%\begin{figure}[h!]
%\begin{minted}{python}
%  def compute(bytes_per_molecule):
%    mb_per_molecule = bytes_per_molecule / 1_000_000
%
%    threads_per_molecule = compute_threads_per_molecule(mb_per_molecule)
%    warps_per_molecule = compute_warps_per_molecule(threads_per_molecule)
%    molecules_per_block = compute_molecules_per_block(warps_per_molecule)
%
%    print_utilization(warps_per_molecule, molecules_per_block)
%
%    print(f"MB per molecule: {mb_per_molecule} MB")
%    print(f"Threads per molecule: {threads_per_molecule}")
%    print(f"Warps per molecule: {warps_per_molecule}")

%
%The output of the script has information on how many threads are required for a single molecule, how many warps this fits within.

%In \autoref{fig:gpu-mem-output} each molecule is $8.3$ MB and thus requires the memory of $18$ threads. Each warp has $32$ threads, so in this case a single molecule fits within a single warp.

\section{Data Coalescing}

% TODO: Udvid og strukturer klart. Forklar at det eksisterende xTB program tager et molekyle ad gangen, og hvad vi fÃ¥r ud af at arbejde pÃ¥ flere samtidigt, that is, at vi nu har muligheden for lockstep parallelisering og at flytte flere molekyler i memory samtidigt.

The program will have data for multiple molecules at once, and this gives opportunity for data coalescing by ensuring spacial locality. Spacial locality refers to having data that is accessed together be close together in memory. We often do not need all the data in a structure at once to perform our computation, so one way to achieve spacial locality is to rewrite our data as structures of arrays (SOA) instead of arrays of structures (AOS) (see \autoref{fig:coalescing}). To allow for coalesced access to the data in device memory, we can essentially realign the data so that parts of the molecules that are accessed together, are also close together in memory.%Doing this should also decrease the amount of copies needed between host and device memory, resulting in overall faster execution.

% TODO: POINTE! Alle threads i en warp skal lave det samme!

If our kernel only accesses a few atoms of a molecule at a time, then it will take more data fetches from global memory if the memory page that we fetch also contains the rest of the molecules, which are unnecessary for the computation. Instead of copying whole molecules at a time, the data should be structured such that only the required data of a molecule is fetched, as that allows the kernel to get that data for more molecules at a time, thus reducing unnecessary fetches and speeding up the computation. The point here is that all the threads in a warp are doing the exact same computation, so we need to efficiently feed them the required data from each of the respective molecules they are working on.

This project is part of a larger pipeline, so the geometric fullerene data that are to be fed into the xTB algorithm is already in device memory when we get it, and it is never meant to leave the device. The xTB implementation should therefore never move any data between the host and device. As such, memory coalescing is something to consider mainly when talking about data accesses from global and shared memory on a device. A whole molecule will most likely not fit in the lower memory levels, so we need to interweave the data in higher levels such that the necessary parts can be accessed as fast as possible. The bottom line is, that when we compute the energies for multiple molecules in the same warp, then we would like to move the necessary data for the molecules at the same time to minimize data accesses to higher levels of memory.


\section{Implementing the Lockstep Algorithm}

Normally we would have to set upper bounds on the amount of shells and orbitals for the atoms of a molecule to ensure that the same instructions are run for all atoms. This is not necessary in our case since we only have carbon atoms, so all of them have them same amount of shells and orbitals. We would also have to treat conditionals, but when working on only one type of atoms, we can eliminate conditionals by replacing it with the only valid branch for carbon atoms.




% TODO: Add figure of the Ada architecture
% TODO: give examples of GPU code
% TODO: Explain in detail the fundamental idea of lockstep and doing the exact same for all isomers.



% TODO: Reformulate! First explain what we want, then what lockstep is and then why it helps us achieve what we want!

%Within the area of computing, the idea of running the same operations in parallel is known as a lockstep system. With a focus on fullerenes, which consists exclusively of carbon atoms, this type of lockstep parallelization is exactly what we want to create, namely a fast and constant flow of data for the broader pipeline that this project is part of.

%Since the executions of the xTB algorithm on each fullerene are completely isolated workloads, this means that the level of parallelization for a given isomerspace, such as C20, scales with the amount of isomers in that group. This means that a much larger isomer group like C200 will also have a much greater level of parallelization.

%The streaming multiprocessors (SMs) on a GPU are slower and simpler than the cores on a CPU. They have no branch prediction or other smart optimization techniques, but instead an SM has more threads it can execute in parallel in comparison to a CPU core which can only execute threads concurrently. The difference is that SMs can truly run its threads simultaniously, while CPU cores rely on context switching to make it seem like proccesses are running simultaniously. With SMs, working only on a few fullerenes will have a massive overhead from spinning up a kernel and copying data from the host(CPU) to the device(GPU), but the problem size for this project makes SMs a great fit.


% TODO: Maybe find an example where we for example iterated through indices of two matrices such as the density and overlap matrices. In this case it could make sense to interweave them such that the indices accessed in iteration 1 is together and so on.

% We want to keep all data on the GPU, so we don't received in on the CPU, it is already on the GPU.
% Maybe explain how data coalescing makes sense when moving data between memoery levels on a GPU?
